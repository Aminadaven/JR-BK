# Jewish Rebellion: Bar Kochba. (in short - JRBK)
## Uncompleted!
## - Learning Project 
JRBK is a learning project for me, i use it to learn:
1. Graphics, including image loading, transparency, drawing, rendering etc.
2. Git and GitHub, and in the future Azure DevOps
3. Maven / Gradle

JRBK is supposed to be a strategy game like https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.igindis.meegame.middleeastempire&hl=iw ,
ikariam, travian, paradox interactive games etc.

## How to run the project:
Despite it is a Java project, you actually don't need any JVM installed, instead:
- Click on run.bat to Launch the current version.
